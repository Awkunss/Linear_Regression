# Linear_Regression
## Introduce:
As the name suggests this algorithm is used for Regression problems and again from the name, we can infer that Linear Regression is a Linear Model. This basically means that this algorithm establishes a linear relationship between the input variable(X) and the single output variable (Y). It is the simplest model in Machine Learning. 
Simple Linear Regression (Univariate Linear Regression) is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:
One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

## Objective
The objective of Simple Linear Regression is to model the relationship between the
two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The steps to perform simple linear
regression are:
1. Determine the dependent and independent variable(s).
2. Collect data for the variables.
3. Create a scatter plot.
4. Estimate the model coefficients for the regression line.
5. Interpret the coefficients.
